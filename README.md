# Transfer Learning-Based Plant Disease Detection & Classification

N.B: Go to Master Branch to see the project Files.

## Overview
This project aims to provide an efficient solution for plant disease detection and classification using transfer learning-based deep learning techniques. It includes a user-friendly web application built with Python Flask, enabling real-time diagnosis for users. By leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and transfer learning, the system can accurately identify various plant diseases, helping farmers and agricultural experts to take timely actions to prevent crop loss.

## Features
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizes transfer learning techniques to adapt pre-trained deep learning models for plant disease detection and classification.
- **User-Friendly Web Application**: Offers an intuitive web interface for users to upload images of plant leaves and receive real-time diagnosis results.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Integrates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for image recognition and classification, ensuring high accuracy in disease detection.
- **Real-Time Diagnosis**: Enables users to receive instant diagnosis results, facilitating timely intervention to mitigate crop damage.
- **Scalability**: Designed to be scalable, allowing for easy integration with additional deep learning models or datasets for expanded functionality.
- **Documentation**: Provides comprehensive documentation and instructions for developers and users to understand and use the system effectively.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the Application**: `python app.py`
4. **Access the Web Application**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to use the application.

## Usage
1. Open the web application in your preferred web browser.
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf that you want to diagnose for diseases.
3. Click on the "Diagnose" button to initiate the diagnosis process.
4. Wait for the system to process the image and display the diagnosis results.
5. Interpret the results displayed on the screen, which will indicate the detected plant disease(s) along with relevant information.
